Notes on Vita game translation & hacking
========================================

*Hi! If you're reading this, you managed to find this site while it's still
under initial construction. If you find the contents useful, I would really
appreciate any support. If you have any fixes, improvements or advice, please
direct them towards the GitHub repo (via issue or pull request), or towards me
on Twitter @raehik . Thanks!*

This site intends to store investigations and write-ups from my experiences
translating a Vita game. As of 2021, there are plentiful tips and tools for Vita
hacking, if you can Google around long enough to find them. I'm hoping for this
site to fill the role of an intermediate guide to Vita game hacking, and a
portal to further resources. There's also some missing documentation on some
common formats and methodologies, which is perhaps unfitting to a wiki. Here I
can write whatever I like without being worried about bringing down wiki content
quality.

*I do not encourage piracy.* Reverse engineering should be a pastime done on
your own legally-owned media for your own use.
